## User-friendly interface

## Using the same email in multiple threads

All emails data is stored in RAM, you can choose the storage model: `local`, `global`, `resource`.

![storage](./src-docs/storage.png)

`local` - Store locally. This threads emails will not be available to other threads.

`global` - Store globally. All threads can access any email data in this storage.

`resource` - Store in resource. Same as global model, but a bit slower.

Storage models `global` and `resource` cannot be cleared automatically. To avoid memory leaks, it is necessary to close the email.
The `local` storage model is cleared automatically when the thread ends.

## The code is designed to keep error rates to minimum

Several categories of errors are present: `common`, `fatal`, `ignored`.
Behavior can be reassigned, each error has its own ID.

![errors](./src-docs/errors.png)

`Common` errors - if they occur, the `Fail` action is called.

`Fatal` errors - if they occur, the `End Script` action is called.

`Ignored` errors are ignored.

## Built-in debugger

Informative and clear.
Shows queries sent, time metrics in ms, errors text, etc.
